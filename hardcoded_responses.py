## Immediate Response Required

Based on the reported conditions at Riverside Medical Center, this constitutes a **Critical Priority** emergency requiring immediate assessment and containment measures.

## Facility Risk Assessment
- **Facility Type:** Healthcare facility with critical operations
- **Roof System:** 40-year-old built-up roof showing age-related vulnerability
- **Water Intrusion Location:** OR wing - highest priority area
- **Operational Impact:** Patient safety and surgical capabilities at risk

## Priority Assessment Areas

### Critical Priority
1. **Membrane Tears & Water Intrusion**
   - Document all visible membrane damage
   - Assess interior water penetration extent
   - Verify structural deck integrity
   - Emergency containment required

### Urgent Priority  
2. **Critical Area Protection**
   - OR wing immediate isolation
   - HVAC system impact evaluation
   - Equipment protection measures
   - Temporary weather protection installation

### Standard Priority
3. **Overall System Evaluation**
   - Complete roof system inspection
   - Drainage system functionality
   - Perimeter and flashing conditions

## Emergency Containment Measures
- Deploy emergency tarping over affected areas
- Establish interior water collection systems
- Isolate affected HVAC zones
- Document all damage with photographic evidence

## Next Steps
1. Complete comprehensive damage assessment using standardized checklist
2. Generate preliminary cost estimates for insurance documentation
3. Coordinate with facility management for repair scheduling
4. Engage emergency roofing contractor for immediate containment

## Timeline Considerations
- Assessment completion: 2-4 hours
- Emergency containment: Immediate (within 1 hour)
- Repair planning: 24-48 hours depending on damage extent""",
