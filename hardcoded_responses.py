## Immediate Actions to Take
1. **Evacuate the Area:** Get everyone out of the building immediately
2. **Call for Help:** Once at a safe distance, call emergency services (911) or your gas company's emergency line
3. **Do Not Create Sparks:** Don't turn on/off any electrical switches, use phones inside, or light matches

## What NOT to Do
* Do not attempt to locate the leak yourself
* Do not turn any electrical equipment on or off
* Do not use your phone until you're safely away from the area

## After Evacuation
* Wait at a safe distance for emergency responders
* Follow all instructions from emergency personnel
* Do not return to the building until professionals declare it safe

## Required Equipment
- 8-mil reinforced polyethylene sheeting
- Spring clamps with rubber guards
- Waterproof tape (commercial grade)
- J-channel water diverters
- Commercial-grade water diversion booms
- Red marking tape for fire-rated assemblies
- Digital camera for documentation

## Execution Process
1. Retrieve the emergency rain kit from the designated weather station (marked with yellow stripes)

2. Unroll 8-mil reinforced polyethylene sheeting from ceiling track to floor

3. Secure top edge to metal framing using spring clamps with rubber guards at 18-inch intervals

4. Pull sheeting taut and create an air gap of 2 inches between sheeting and installed panels

5. Secure bottom edge with water-diverting J-channel to direct water away from base track

6. Seal all penetrations (electrical boxes, HVAC openings) with waterproof tape

7. Pay special attention to fire-rated assemblies - mark these with red tape to ensure inspection after rainfall

8. Place commercial-grade water diversion booms in doorways and at perimeter walls

9. Document protected areas with time-stamped photos referencing room numbers per construction drawings

10. Monitor mechanical and electrical penetrations every 30 minutes until rainfall subsides

## Critical Considerations
- Type X fire-rated assemblies must receive priority protection
- Drywall that has been wet for more than 24 hours typically requires replacement
- Document all affected areas for insurance and quality control purposes
- Follow up with moisture meter testing after rainfall event

## Safety Notes
- Do not use metal ladders during active rainfall
- Ensure proper fall protection when working near openings
- Report any electrical concerns immediately to site supervisor
- Evacuate areas where ceiling materials show signs of saturation""",

## Communication Timeline Analysis

After reviewing all project communications, I've identified conflicting information regarding the HVAC system change on the Westside project.

### Key Findings:
* Original specification was clearly for Airflow 3000 model (James Rodriguez, April 1)
* Supply chain issues were discussed in weekly meeting (Procore meeting minutes, April 5)
* Alternative system (ThermalTech Pro) was proposed to Maria Chen, not James (April 6)
* No formal change order was created or distributed
* Final installation approval was given under time pressure without specific system confirmation

### Contract Implications:
According to Section 12.3 of the contract, substitutions require written approval from the original requester and proper documentation through a change order process.

## Recommended Actions:
1. Create retroactive change order documentation
2. Conduct technical comparison of installed vs. specified system
3. Negotiate cost adjustment based on documented benefits
4. Revise approval protocols to prevent future issues
