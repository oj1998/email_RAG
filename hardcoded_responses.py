1. **Evacuate the Area:** Get everyone out of the building immediately
2. **Call for Help:** Once at a safe distance, call emergency services (911) or your gas company's emergency line
3. **Do Not Create Sparks:** Don't turn on/off any electrical switches, use phones inside, or light matches

## What NOT to Do
* Do not attempt to locate the leak yourself
* Do not turn any electrical equipment on or off
* Do not use your phone until you're safely away from the area

## After Evacuation
* Wait at a safe distance for emergency responders
* Follow all instructions from emergency personnel
* Do not return to the building until professionals declare it safe

Our Standard Operating Procedures require **immediate work stoppage and specialist intervention** when severe mold is discovered during demolition.

According to SOP Section 4.2 - Environmental Hazards, all demolition work must cease immediately upon discovery of unexpected mold conditions. A certified mold specialist must assess the situation before work can resume.

This protocol was established following lessons learned from the Harbor View project where initial mold discovery led to extensive remediation costs due to delayed specialist involvement.

## Required Immediate Actions:
1. Stop all demolition work in affected area
2. Contact certified mold specialist within 4 hours
3. Establish temporary containment if advised by specialist
4. Document discovery with photos and location mapping
5. Notify project manager and safety coordinator

## Next Steps:
- Await specialist assessment before resuming any work
- Prepare for potential scope and schedule adjustments
- Review insurance coverage for environmental discoveries""",

## Required Equipment
- 8-mil reinforced polyethylene sheeting
- Spring clamps with rubber guards
- Waterproof tape (commercial grade)
- J-channel water diverters
- Commercial-grade water diversion booms
- Red marking tape for fire-rated assemblies
- Digital camera for documentation

## Execution Process
1. Retrieve the emergency rain kit from the designated weather station (marked with yellow stripes)

2. Unroll 8-mil reinforced polyethylene sheeting from ceiling track to floor

3. Secure top edge to metal framing using spring clamps with rubber guards at 18-inch intervals

4. Pull sheeting taut and create an air gap of 2 inches between sheeting and installed panels

5. Secure bottom edge with water-diverting J-channel to direct water away from base track

6. Seal all penetrations (electrical boxes, HVAC openings) with waterproof tape

7. Pay special attention to fire-rated assemblies - mark these with red tape to ensure inspection after rainfall

8. Place commercial-grade water diversion booms in doorways and at perimeter walls

9. Document protected areas with time-stamped photos referencing room numbers per construction drawings

10. Monitor mechanical and electrical penetrations every 30 minutes until rainfall subsides

## Critical Considerations
- Type X fire-rated assemblies must receive priority protection
- Drywall that has been wet for more than 24 hours typically requires replacement
- Document all affected areas for insurance and quality control purposes
- Follow up with moisture meter testing after rainfall event

## Safety Notes
- Do not use metal ladders during active rainfall
- Ensure proper fall protection when working near openings
- Report any electrical concerns immediately to site supervisor
- Evacuate areas where ceiling materials show signs of saturation""",

## Temperature Variations

Global measurements show significant variations across regions. Northern areas experience more pronounced warming, with some regions showing temperature increases of up to 2.1¬∞C above pre-industrial levels. Southern hemisphere changes are more moderate, averaging 0.8-1.2¬∞C increases.

## Precipitation Patterns

Precipitation patterns show high regional variability:
- Increased rainfall intensity in equatorial regions
- Prolonged drought conditions in mid-latitudes
- More frequent extreme precipitation events globally

## Source Conflicts

Different climate models project varying outcomes for certain regions, particularly in predicting monsoon pattern shifts across Southeast Asia and agricultural impacts in transitional climate zones.

### Specific Code Requirements:
- **IBC Section 517.13:** Healthcare facilities electrical systems
- **Maryland Amendment MA-517.13.2:** Metal conduit required for patient care areas  
- **Montgomery County Amendment MC-E-1.4:** Enhanced grounding for medical facilities

### Technical Requirements:
- All low voltage cables in patient care areas must use EMT or rigid metal conduit
- Metal junction boxes with proper bonding provisions
- Enhanced equipment grounding system connectivity
- Separate conduits for power and low voltage in patient areas

### Compliance Impact:
- **Cost Increase:** $8,400 - $12,600 for metallic conduit upgrade
- **Schedule Impact:** Additional 3-4 days for specialized installation
- **Affected Systems:** Dental equipment controls, patient monitoring, emergency communication

The current contract specification for PVC conduit will require modification to ensure code compliance and permit approval.""",

* Application temperature must be between 45-85¬∞F with surface moisture reading below 12%
* Do not apply if rain is expected within 48 hours

### Proper Installation Sequence
* Primary membrane must cure for 24 hours before secondary layer application
* West-facing installations require double-layer application at seams with 6" overlap (increased from 4" in previous standard)
* Use BlueBond-X adhesive formula for any installation within 15 miles of saltwater

### Quality Assurance
* Schedule inspection after installation
* Validate installation meets warranty requirements

### Common Installation Errors to Avoid
* Insufficient overlap at seams (most common failure point)
* Using standard adhesive in coastal applications
* Applying second layer before primary membrane has fully cured
* Improper trowel technique leading to uneven application""",

## Communication Timeline Analysis

After reviewing all project communications, I've identified conflicting information regarding the HVAC system change on the Westside project.

### Key Findings:
* Original specification was clearly for Airflow 3000 model (James Rodriguez, April 1)
* Supply chain issues were discussed in weekly meeting (Procore meeting minutes, April 5)
* Alternative system (ThermalTech Pro) was proposed to Maria Chen, not James (April 6)
* No formal change order was created or distributed
* Final installation approval was given under time pressure without specific system confirmation

### Contract Implications:
According to Section 12.3 of the contract, substitutions require written approval from the original requester and proper documentation through a change order process.

## Recommended Actions:
1. Create retroactive change order documentation
2. Conduct technical comparison of installed vs. specified system
3. Negotiate cost adjustment based on documented benefits
4. Revise approval protocols to prevent future issues

### Customer Issue: Edge Thickness Variation

## Initial Assessment 
Before opening any panels, verify with the customer:
- When the issue first appeared (after material change, maintenance, etc.)
- Whether the issue is consistent or intermittent
- If any recent maintenance has been performed on the machine
- If they have documentation of current material specifications

## Service Checklist
Perform standard safety lockout/tagout procedure before any mechanical inspection. Document all findings in the service report for warranty coverage.

## Common Root Causes
Based on recent service data from similar installations, probable causes include:
- Entry roller misalignment (42% of cases)
- Incorrect pressure settings for material gauge (31%)
- Material property inconsistencies (18%)
- Calibration drift on hydraulic sensors (9%)

## Required Service Tools
- Alignment laser kit (PN: ALK-SP100)
- Calibrated feeler gauge set
- Digital torque wrench (40-80Nm)
- Pressure test kit with digital gauge
- Service tablet with latest firmware

Follow each diagnostic path carefully. If multiple issues are found, document all findings for the customer before making adjustments.""",

## Pre-Assembly Requirements
Before beginning assembly, verify all parts have been received and match the bill of materials. Check for any shipping damage. Ensure assembly area meets space requirements (minimum 10m x 6m clear floor space).

## Main Assembly Sequences
The Scotpanel roll forming machine assembly is divided into these primary subassemblies:
- Entry guide and shaft assembly
- Drive system installation
- Forming station setup (varies by profile configuration)
- Exit and cutoff mechanism assembly
- Control system wiring and setup

## Critical Assembly Points
- All shaft alignments must be within 0.05mm tolerance
- Bearing installation requires induction heating (80-120¬∞C)
- Torque specifications must be followed exactly
- Roller gaps must be set according to profile specification drawings
- Lubrication ports must be properly aligned before final assembly
